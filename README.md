# Project-09-Xamarin-Android

This repository is for my Project 9 in Xamarin Android with Azure in Visual Studio .NET. I executed this application in my android Cellphone.

The application connect with the services in Azure to autenticate my credentials in Azure SQL Server. We managed the access to resources in the Android OS, we saw different configurations when we changed or rotated the screen of the cellphone. 

Here, we can see the application:
